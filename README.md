## SUMMARY:
Please make sure you have completed the soot survey at:
    [soot.binghamton.edu](https://soot.binghamton.edu)

Please list the urls for the APIs you used:
https://api.covid19api.com/summary
https://covid19.mathdro.id/api/countries/USA

Summary of Program:
This program pulls data from two APIs in order to provide an active count of nationwide, USA and New York COVID related deaths. I chose this as a topic because it felt appropriate and timely; though deeply sad, it is important to keep these running death tolls in order to stress the severity and danger that COVID still poses to us and our livelihood. Looking at these numbers especially is an eye-opening experience, revealing just how many lives this terrible disease has taken. 

Most Challenging topic in the course:
I would say I had the most difficulty with advanced strings in this course. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
To my knowledge, all parts of the assignment work fully. 

## REFERENCES:
Aside from using the lab description and class notes, I also used the API library provided: 
https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#healthusaa 

Also, I used the following links to better understand APIs and how to correctly use them: 



## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I had a wonderful time in CS 110! Though challenging, the output was rewarding, no matter how many times I lost my mind over seeing the words "syntax error". Thank you for everything!
